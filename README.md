Plant species identification using deep learning methods to address the PlantCLEF 2025 Kaggle challenge.

# Abstract

This project aims at the PlantCLEF2025 Kaggle/LifeCLEF challenge on multi-species plant identification in unlabeled vegetation quadrat images. We describe a pipeline for zero-shot multi-species plant identification using a fine-tuned pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) model combined with methods of high-resolution image tiling, false positive reduction, and prediction aggregation.
